I am a first-year PhD student in Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) at Syracuse University, NY. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am honored to be supervised by [Dr. Yuzhe (Richard) Tang](https://tristartom.github.io/).

My research interests focus on Cybersecurity, with particular emphasis on Blockchain and LLM security.
